#Buzz_Bot

This is a tweepy implementation of a twitter bot that finds contests from the twitter streaming api and follows retweets and likes the contest tweet in order to enter the contest. The bot needs its own api key and consumer key from Twitter. Also there has not been an implementation for preventing follower churn.
