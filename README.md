#Buzz_Bot

This is a tweepy implementation of a twitter bot that finds contests from the twitter streaming api and follows retweets and likes the contest tweet in order to enter the contest. The bot needs its own api key and consumer key from Twitter. Also there has not been an implementation for preventing follower churn.

I named my file where my api settings were stored credentials.py and then imported and used the consumer keys and access keys. There are natural language processing libraries along with a few others that I plan to use in the future but are not yet needed.
